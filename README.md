## Project Overview
Karhano Market is a web application designed to facilitate online shopping for various products. Built on ASP.NET Core, this application provides users with a seamless shopping experience and efficient product management. It leverages a local SQL database for data storage and retrieval, making it suitable for development and testing environments.

## Installation
